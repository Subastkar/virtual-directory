# Virtual Directory

Program that simulates command execution for directory management.

# Dependencies

Node v14.17.0
Install package dependencies:
```
npm install
```

Also a `txt` file that contains the seed to commands to execute is required.

# Execution

This code can be run with this two commands:
```
node index.js file/path
```
or
```
npm run client file/path
```

# Test

```
npm test
```

# Notes

There is plenty room for improvement, one of the TODO would be to make a method that contains the iteration of the arguments but to be honest I couldn't figure it out in the remaingin time that I had.
